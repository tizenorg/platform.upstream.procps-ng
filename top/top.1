.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\*(WE \*(CL


The traditional switches '\-' and whitespace are optional.

.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The \*(WE program provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system.
It can display\fB system\fR summary information as well as a list of
\*(TT currently being managed by the Linux kernel.
The types of system summary information shown and the types, order and
size of information displayed for processes are all user configurable
and that configuration can be made persistent across restarts.

The program provides a limited interactive interface for process
manipulation as well as a much more extensive interface for personal
configuration \*(Em encompassing every aspect of its operation.
And while \*(WE is referred to throughout this document, you are free
to name the program anything you wish.
That new name, possibly an alias, will then be reflected on \*(We's
display and used when reading and writing a \*(CF.

.SS Operation
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
When operating \*(We, the two most important keys are the help ('h' or '?')
key and quit ('q') key.
Alternatively, you could simply use the traditional interrupt key ('^C')
when you're done.

When started for the first time, you'll be presented with these traditional
elements on the main \*(We screen: 1) Summary Area; 2) Fields/Columns Header;
3) Task Area.
Each of these will be explored in the sections that follow.
There is also an Input/Message line between the Summary Area and Columns
Header which needs no further explanation.

The main \*(We screen is \fIgenerally\fR quite adaptive to changes in
terminal dimensions under X-Windows.
Other \*(We screens may be less so, especially those with static text.
It ultimately depends, however, on your particular window manager and
terminal emulator.
There may be occasions when their view of terminal size and current contents
differs from \*(We's view, which is always based on operating system calls.

Following any re-size operation, if a \*(We screen is corrupted, appears
incomplete or disordered, simply typing something innocuous like a
punctuation character or cursor motion key will usually restore it.
In extreme cases, the following sequence almost certainly will:
.Bd -literal -compact
       \fIkey/cmd  objective \fR
       ^Z       \fBsuspend\fR \*(We
       fg       \fBresume\fR \*(We
       <Left>   force a screen \fBredraw\fR (if necessary)
.Ed

But if the display is still corrupted, there is one more step you could try.
Insert this command after \*(We has been suspended but before resuming it.
.Bd -literal -compact
       \fIkey/cmd  objective \fR
       reset    restore your \fBterminal settings\fR
.Ed

\*(NT the width of \*(We's display will be limited to \*(WX positions.
Displaying all fields requires \*(WF characters.
Remaining screen width is usually allocated to any variable width columns
currently visible.
The variable width columns, such as COMMAND, are noted in topic
3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields.
Actual output width may also be influenced by the \-w switch, which is
discussed in topic 1. COMMAND\-LINE Options.

Lastly, some of \*(We's screens or functions require the use of cursor
motion keys like the standard \*(KAs plus the Home, End, PgUp and PgDn keys.
If your terminal or emulator does not provide those keys, the following
combinations are accepted as alternatives:
.Bd -literal -compact
      \fI key      equivalent-key-combinations \fR
       Up       alt +\fB \\\fR      or  alt +\fB k \fR
       Down     alt +\fB /\fR      or  alt +\fB j \fR
       Left     alt +\fB <\fR      or  alt +\fB h \fR
       Right    alt +\fB >\fR      or  alt +\fB l \fR(lower case L)
       PgUp     alt +\fB Up\fR     or  alt + ctrl +\fB k \fR
       PgDn     alt +\fB Down\fR   or  alt + ctrl +\fB j \fR
       Home     alt +\fB Left\fR   or  alt + ctrl +\fB h \fR
       End      alt +\fB Right\fR  or  alt + ctrl +\fB l \fR
.Ed

The \fBUp\fR and \fBDown\fR \*(KAs have special significance when prompted
for line input terminated with the <Enter> key.
Those keys, or their aliases, can be used to retrieve previous input lines
which can then be edited and re-input.
And there are four additional keys available with line oriented input.
.Bd -literal -compact
      \fI key      special-significance \fR
       Up       recall \fBolder\fR strings for re-editing
       Down     recall \fBnewer\fR strings or \fBerase\fR entire line
       Insert   toggle between \fBinsert\fR and \fBovertype\fR modes
       Delete   character \fBremoved\fR at cursor, moving others left
       Home     jump to \fBbeginning\fR of input line
       End      jump to \fBend\fR of input line
.Ed

.SS Startup Defaults
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following startup defaults assume no \*(CF, thus no user customizations.
Even so, items shown with an \*(AK could be overridden through the
command-line.
All are explained in detail in the sections that follow.

.Bd -literal
    \fIGlobal-defaults\fR
       'A' - Alt display      Off (full-screen)
     * 'd' - Delay time       3.0 seconds

.SH 1. COMMAND-LINE Options
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The command-line syntax for \*(We consists of:

  \*(CL

The typically mandatory switches ('\-') and even whitespace are completely
optional.

.TP 5
\-\fBh\fR | \-\fBv\fR :\fI Help/Version \fR
Show library version and the usage prompt, then quit.

.TP 5
\-\fBb\fR :\fI Batch-mode\fR operation \fR
Starts \*(We in 'Batch' mode, which could be useful for sending output
from \*(We to other programs or to a file.
In this mode, \*(We will not accept input and runs until the iterations
limit you've set with the '\-n' \*(CO or until killed.

.TP 5
\-\fBc\fR :\fI Command-line/Program-name\fR toggle \fR
Starts \*(We with the last remembered 'c' state reversed.
Thus, if \*(We was displaying command lines, now that field will show program
names, and visa versa.
\*(XC 'c' \*(CI for additional information.

.TP 5
\-\fBd\fR :\fI Delay-time\fR interval as:\ \ \fB-d ss.t\fR (\fIsecs\fR.\fItenths\fR) \fR
Specifies the delay between screen updates, and overrides the corresponding
value in one's personal \*(CF or the startup default.
Later this can be changed with the 'd' or 's' \*(CIs.

Fractional seconds are honored, but a negative number is not allowed.
In all cases, however, such changes are prohibited if \*(We is running
in 'Secure mode', except for root (unless the 's' \*(CO was used).
For additional information on 'Secure mode' \*(Xt 6a. SYSTEM Configuration File.

.TP 5
\-\fBH\fR :\fI Threads-mode\fR operation \fR
Instructs \*(We to display individual threads.
Without this \*(CO a summation of all threads in each process is shown.
Later this can be changed with the 'H' \*(CI.

.TP 5
\-\fBi\fR :\fI Idle-process\fR toggle \fR
Starts \*(We with the last remembered 'i' state reversed.
When this toggle is \*F, tasks that have not used any \*(PU since the
last update will not be displayed.
For additional information regarding this toggle
\*(Xt 4c. TASK AREA Commands, SIZE.

.TP 5
\-\fBn\fR :\fI Number-of-iterations\fR limit as:\fB\ \ \-n number \fR
Specifies the maximum number of iterations, or frames, \*(We should
produce before ending.

.TP 5
\-\fBo\fR :\fI Override-sort-field\fR as:\fB\ \ \-o fieldname \fR
Specifies the name of the field on which tasks will be sorted, independent
of what is reflected in the configuration file.
You can prepend a '+' or '\-' to the field name to also override the sort direction.
A leading '+' will force sorting high to low, whereas a '\-' will ensure a low to high
ordering.

This option exists primarily to support automated/scripted batch mode
operation.

.TP 5
\-\fBO\fR :\fI Output-field-names \fR
This option acts as a form of help for the above \-o option.
It will cause \*(We to print each of the available field names on a
separate line, then quit.
Such names are subject to nls translation.

.TP 5
\-\fBp\fR :\fI Monitor-PIDs\fR mode as:\fB\ \ \-pN1 -pN2 ...\fR\ \ or\fB\ \ \-pN1,N2,N3 ... \fR
Monitor only processes with specified process IDs.
This option can be given up to \*(WP times, or you can provide a comma delimited
list with up to \*(WP pids.
Co-mingling both approaches is permitted.

A pid value of zero will be treated as the process id of the \*(We program
itself once it is running.

This is a \*(CO only and should you wish to return to normal operation,
it is not necessary to quit and and restart \*(We \*(Em just issue any
of these \*(CIs: '=', 'u' or 'U'.

The 'p', 'u' and 'U' \*(COs are mutually exclusive.

.TP 5
\-\fBs\fR :\fI Secure-mode\fR operation \fR
Starts \*(We with secure mode forced, even for root.
This mode is far better controlled through the system \*(CF
(\*(Xt 6. FILES).

.TP 5
\-\fBS\fR :\fI Cumulative-time\fR toggle \fR
Starts \*(We with the last remembered 'S' state reversed.
When 'Cumulative time' mode is \*O, each process is listed with the \*(Pu
time that it and its dead children have used.
\*(XC 'S' \*(CI for additional information regarding this mode.

.TP 5
\-\fBu\fR | \-\fBU\fR :\fI User-filter-mode\fR as:\ \ \fB-u\fR | \fB-U number\fR or\fB name \fR
Display only processes with a user id or user name matching that given.
The '\-u' option matches on \fI effective\fR user whereas the '\-U' option
matches on\fI any\fR user (real, effective, saved, or filesystem).

Prepending an exclamation point ('!') to the user id or name instucts top to
display only processes with users not matching the one provided.

The 'p', 'u' and 'U' \*(COs are mutually exclusive.

.TP 5
\-\fBw\fR :\fI Output-width-override\fR as:\ \ \fB-w\fR [\fB number\fR ] \fR
In 'Batch' mode, when used without an argument \*(We will format
output using the COLUMNS= and LINES= environment variables, if set.
Otherwise, width will be fixed at the maximum \*(WX columns.
With an argument, output width can be decreased or increased (up to \*(WX)
but the number of rows is considered unlimited.

In normal display mode, when used without an argument \*(We will\fI attempt\fR
to format output using the COLUMNS= and LINES= environment variables, if set.
With an argument, output width can only be decreased, not increased.
Whether using environment variables or an argument with \-w, when\fI not\fR
in 'Batch' mode actual terminal dimensions can never be exceeded.

\*(NT Without the use of this \*(CO, output width is always based on the
terminal at which \*(We was invoked whether or not in 'Batch' mode.

.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH 2. SUMMARY Display
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Each of the following three areas are individually controlled through
one or more \*(CIs.
\*(XT 4b. SUMMARY AREA Commands for additional information regarding
these provisions.

.\" ......................................................................
.SS 2a. UPTIME and LOAD Averages
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
This portion consists of a single line containing:
.Bd -literal -compact
    \fBprogram\fR or\fB window\fR name, depending on display mode
    current time and length of time since last boot
    total number of users
    system load avg over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes
.Ed

.\" ......................................................................
.SS 2b. TASK and CPU States
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
This portion consists of a minimum of two lines.
In an SMP environment, additional lines can reflect individual \*(PU
state percentages.

Line 1 shows total\fB tasks\fR or\fB threads\fR, depending on the state
of the Threads-mode toggle.
That total is further classified as:
.Bd -literal -compact
    running; sleeping; stopped; zombie
.Ed

Line 2 shows \*(PU state percentages based on the interval since the
last refresh.  Where two labels are shown below, those for more recent
kernel versions are shown first.
.Bd -literal -compact
    \fBus\fR,\fB user\fR    : time running un-niced user processes
    \fBsy\fR,\fB system\fR  : time running kernel processes
    \fBni\fR,\fB nice\fR    : time running niced user processes
    \fBwa\fR,\fB IO-wait\fR : time waiting for I/O completion
    \fBhi\fR : time spent servicing hardware interrupts
    \fBsi\fR : time spent servicing software interrupts
    \fBst\fR : time stolen from this vm by the hypervisor
.Ed

.\" ......................................................................
.SS 2c. MEMORY Usage
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
This portion consists of two lines which may express values in kibibytes (KiB)
through exbibytes (EiB) depending on the scaling factor enforced
with the 'E' \*(CI.

Line 1 reflects \*(MP, classified as:
.Bd -literal -compact
    total, used, free and buffers
.Ed

Line 2 reflects mostly \*(MV, classified as:
.Bd -literal -compact
    total, used, free and cached (which is \*(MP)
.Ed

This table may help in interpreting the scaled values displayed:
.Bd -literal -compact
    KiB = kibibyte = 1024 bytes
    MiB = mebibyte = 1024 KiB = 1,048,576 bytes
    GiB = gibibyte = 1024 MiB = 1,073,741,824 bytes
    TiB = tebibyte = 1024 GiB = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes
    PiB = pebibyte = 1024 TiB = 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes
    EiB = exbibyte = 1024 PiB = 1,152,921,504,606,846,976 bytes
.Ed

.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH 3. FIELDS / Columns
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.\" ......................................................................
.SS 3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Listed below are \*(We's available process fields (columns).
They are shown in strict ascii alphabetical order.
You may customize their position and whether or not they are displayable
with the 'f' or 'F' (Fields Management) \*(CIs.

Any field is selectable as the sort field, and you control whether they
are sorted high-to-low or low-to-high.
For additional information on sort provisions
\*(Xt 4c. TASK AREA Commands, SORTING.

The fields related to \*(MP or \*(MV reference '(KiB)' as the default,
unsuffixed display mode.
Such fields can, however, be scaled differently via the 'e' \*(CI.

.TP 4
 1.\fB %CPU \*(Em \*(PU Usage \fR
The task's share of the elapsed \*(PU time since the last screen update,
expressed as a percentage of total \*(PU time.

In a true SMP environment, if a process is multi-threaded and \*(We is
\fInot\fR operating in Threads mode, amounts greater than 100% may be
reported.
You toggle Threads mode with the 'H' \*(CI.

Also for multi-processor environments, if 'Irix mode' is \*F, \*(We
will operate in 'Solaris mode' where a task's \*(Pu usage will be
divided by the total number of \*(PUs.
You toggle 'Irix/Solaris' modes with the 'I' \*(CI.

.TP 4
 2.\fB %MEM \*(Em Memory Usage (RES) \fR
A task's currently used share of available \*(MP.

.TP 4
 3.\fB CGROUPS \*(Em Control Groups \fR
The names of the control group(s) to which a process belongs,
or '\-' if not applicable for that process.

Control Groups provide for allocating resources (cpu, memory, network
bandwidth, etc.) among installation-defined groups of processes.
They enable fine-grained control over allocating, denying, prioritizing,
managing and monitoring those resources.

Many different hierarchies of cgroups can exist simultaneously on a system
and each hierarchy is attached to one or more subsystems.
A subsystem represents a single resource.

\*(NT The 'CGROUPS' field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be allocated
all remaining screen width (up to the maximum \*(WX characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation.
\*(XT 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information on accessing
any truncated data.

.TP 4
 4.\fB CODE \*(Em Code Size (KiB) \fR
The amount of \*(MP devoted to executable code, also known as
the 'text resident set' size or TRS.

.TP 4
 5.\fB COMMAND \*(Em Command\fB Name\fR or Command\fB Line \fR
Display the command line used to start a task or the name of the associated
program.
You toggle between command\fI line\fR and\fI name\fR with 'c', which is both
a \*(CO and an \*(CI.

When you've chosen to display command lines, processes without a command
line (like kernel threads) will be shown with only the program name in
brackets, as in this example:
    \fR[kthreadd]

This field may also be impacted by the 'forest view' display mode.
\*(XC 'V' \*(CI for additional information regarding that mode.

\*(NT The 'COMMAND' field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be allocated
all remaining screen width (up to the maximum \*(WX characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation.
This is especially true for this field when command lines are being
displayed (the 'c' \*(CI.)
\*(XT 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information on accessing
any truncated data.

.TP 4
 6.\fB DATA \*(Em Data + Stack Size (KiB) \fR
The amount of \*(MP devoted to other than executable code, also known as
the 'data resident set' size or DRS.

.TP 4
 7.\fB ENVIRON \*(Em Environment variables \fR
Display all of the environment variables, if any, as seen by the
respective processes.
These variables will be displayed in their raw native order, not the
sorted order you are accustomed to seeing with an unqualified 'set'.

\*(NT The 'ENVIRON' field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be allocated
all remaining screen width (up to the maximum \*(WX characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation.
This is especially true for this field.
\*(XT 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information on accessing
any truncated data.

.TP 4
 8.\fB Flags \*(Em Task Flags \fR
This column represents the task's current scheduling flags which are
expressed in hexadecimal notation and with zeros suppressed.
These flags are officially documented in <linux/sched.h>.

.TP 4
 9.\fB GID \*(Em Group Id \fR
The\fI effective\fR group ID.

.TP 4
10.\fB GROUP \*(Em Group Name \fR
The\fI effective\fR group name.

.TP 4
11.\fB NI \*(Em Nice Value \fR
The nice value of the task.
A negative nice value means higher priority, whereas a positive nice value
means lower priority.
Zero in this field simply means priority will not be adjusted in determining
a task's dispatch-ability.

.TP 4
12.\fB P \*(Em Last used \*(PU (SMP) \fR
A number representing the last used processor.
In a true SMP environment this will likely change frequently since the kernel
intentionally uses weak affinity.
Also, the very act of running \*(We may break this weak affinity and cause more
processes to change \*(PUs more often (because of the extra demand for
\*(Pu time).

.TP 4
13.\fB PGRP \*(Em Process Group Id \fR
Every process is member of a unique process group which is used for
distribution of signals and by terminals to arbitrate requests for their
input and output.
When a process is created (forked), it becomes a member of the process
group of its parent.
By convention, this value equals the process ID (\*(Xa PID) of the first
member of a process group, called the process group leader.

.TP 4
14.\fB PID \*(Em Process Id \fR
The task's unique process ID, which periodically wraps, though never
restarting at zero.
In kernel terms, it is a dispatchable entity defined by a 'task_struct'.

This value may also be used as: a process group ID (\*(Xa PGRP);
a session ID for the session leader (\*(Xa SID);
a thread group ID for the thread group leader (\*(Xa TGID);
and a TTY process group ID for the process group leader (\*(Xa TPGID).

.TP 4
15.\fB PPID \*(Em Parent Process Id \fR
The process ID (pid) of a task's parent.

.TP 4
16.\fB PR \*(Em Priority \fR
The scheduling priority of the task.
If you see 'rt' in this field, it means the task is running under
'real time' scheduling priority.

Under linux, real time priority is somewhat misleading since traditionally
the operating itself was not preemptable.
And while the 2.6 kernel can be made mostly preemptable, it is not always so.

.TP 4
17.\fB RES \*(Em Resident Memory Size (KiB) \fR
The non-swapped \*(MP a task has used.

.TP 4
18.\fB RUID \*(Em Real User Id \fR
The\fI real\fR user ID.

.TP 4
19.\fB RUSER \*(Em Real User Name \fR
The\fI real\fR user name.

.TP 4
20.\fB S \*(Em Process Status \fR
The status of the task which can be one of:
    '\fBD\fR' = uninterruptible sleep
    '\fBR\fR' = running
    '\fBS\fR' = sleeping
    '\fBT\fR' = traced or stopped
    '\fBZ\fR' = zombie

Tasks shown as running should be more properly thought of as 'ready to run'
\*(Em their task_struct is simply represented on the Linux run-queue.
Even without a true SMP machine, you may see numerous tasks in this state
depending on \*(We's delay interval and nice value.

.TP 4
21.\fB SHR \*(Em Shared Memory Size (KiB) \fR
The amount of \*(MS available to a task, not all of which is
typically resident.
It simply reflects memory that could be potentially shared with
other processes.

.TP 4
22.\fB SID \*(Em Session Id \fR
A session is a collection of process groups (\*(Xa PGRP),
usually established by the login shell.
A newly forked process joins the session of its creator.
By convention, this value equals the process ID (\*(Xa PID) of the first
member of the session, called the session leader, which is usually the
login shell.

.TP 4
23.\fB SUID \*(Em Saved User Id \fR
The\fI saved\fR user ID.

.TP 4
24.\fB SUPGIDS \*(Em Supplementary Group IDs \fR
The IDs of any supplementary group(s) established at login or
inherited from a task's parent.
They are displayed in a comma delimited list.

\*(NT The 'SUPGIDS' field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be allocated
all remaining screen width (up to the maximum \*(WX characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation.
\*(XT 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information on accessing
any truncated data.

.TP 4
25.\fB SUPGRPS \*(Em Supplementary Group Names \fR
The names of any supplementary group(s) established at login or
inherited from a task's parent.
They are displayed in a comma delimited list.

\*(NT The 'SUPGRPS' field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be allocated
all remaining screen width (up to the maximum \*(WX characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation.
\*(XT 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information on accessing
any truncated data.

.TP 4
26.\fB SUSER \*(Em Saved User Name \fR
The\fI saved\fR user name.

.TP 4
27.\fB SWAP \*(Em Swapped Size (KiB) \fR
The non-resident portion of a task's address space.

.TP 4
28.\fB TGID \*(Em Thread Group Id \fR
The ID of the thread group to which a task belongs.
It is the PID of the thread group leader.
In kernel terms, it represents those tasks that share an 'mm_struct'.

.TP 4
29.\fB TIME \*(Em \*(PU Time \fR
Total \*(PU time the task has used since it started.
When 'Cumulative mode' is \*O, each process is listed with the \*(Pu
time that it and its dead children have used.
You toggle 'Cumulative mode' with 'S', which is both a \*(CO and an \*(CI.
\*(XC 'S' \*(CI for additional information regarding this mode.

.TP 4
30.\fB TIME+ \*(Em \*(PU Time, hundredths \fR
The same as 'TIME', but reflecting more granularity through hundredths
of a second.

.TP 4
31.\fB TPGID \*(Em Tty Process Group Id \fR
The process group ID of the foreground process for the connected tty,
or \-1 if a process is not connected to a terminal.
By convention, this value equals the process ID (\*(Xa PID) of the
the process group leader (\*(Xa PGRP).

.TP 4
32.\fB TTY \*(Em Controlling Tty \fR
The name of the controlling terminal.
This is usually the device (serial port, pty, etc.) from which the
process was started, and which it uses for input or output.
However, a task need not be associated with a terminal, in which case
you'll see '?' displayed.

.TP 4
33.\fB UID \*(Em User Id \fR
The\fI effective\fR user ID of the task's owner.

.TP 4
34.\fB USED \*(Em Memory in Use (KiB) \fR
This field represents the non-swapped \*(MP a task has used (RES) plus
the non-resident portion of its address space (SWAP).

.TP 4
35.\fB USER \*(Em User Name \fR
The\fI effective\fR user name of the task's owner.

.TP 4
36.\fB VIRT \*(Em Virtual Memory Size (KiB) \fR
The total amount of \*(MV used by the task.
It includes all code, data and shared libraries plus pages that have been
swapped out and pages that have been mapped but not used.

.TP 4
37.\fB WCHAN \*(Em Sleeping in Function \fR
Depending on the availability of the kernel link map ('System.map'), this
field will show the name or the address of the kernel function in which the
task is currently sleeping.
Running tasks will display a dash ('\-') in this column.

By displaying this field, \*(We's own working set could be increased by over
700Kb, depending on the kernel version.
Should that occur, your only means of reducing that overhead will be to stop
and restart \*(We.

.TP 4
38.\fB nDRT \*(Em Dirty Pages Count \fR
The number of pages that have been modified since they were last
written to \*(AS.
Dirty pages must be written to \*(AS before the corresponding physical
memory location can be used for some other virtual page.

.TP 4
39.\fB nMaj \*(Em Major Page Fault Count \fR
The number of\fB major\fR page faults that have occurred for a task.
A page fault occurs when a process attempts to read from or write to a
virtual page that is not currently present in its address space.
A major page fault is when \*(AS access is involved in making that
page available.

.TP 4
40.\fB nMin \*(Em Minor Page Fault count \fR
The number of\fB minor\fR page faults that have occurred for a task.
A page fault occurs when a process attempts to read from or write to a
virtual page that is not currently present in its address space.
A minor page fault does not involve \*(AS access in making that
page available.

.TP 4
41.\fB nTH \*(Em Number of Threads \fR
The number of threads associated with a process.

.TP 4
42.\fB vMj \*(Em Major Page Fault Count Delta\fR
The number of\fB major\fR page faults that have occurred since the
last update (see nMaj).

.TP 4
43.\fB vMn \*(Em Minor Page Fault Count Delta\fR
The number of\fB minor\fR page faults that have occurred since the

.SS 4a. GLOBAL Commands
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The global \*(CIs are\fB always\fR available\fR in both \*(FM and \*(AM.
However, some of these \*(CIs are\fB not available\fR when running
in 'Secure mode'.

If you wish to know in advance whether or not your \*(We has been
secured, simply ask for help and view the system summary on the second
line.

.TP 7
\ \ <\fBEnter\fR> or <\fBSpace\fR> :\fIRefresh-Display \fR
These commands awaken \*(We and following receipt of any input
the entire display will be repainted.
They also force an update of any hotplugged \*(Pu or \*(MP changes.

Use either of these keys if you have a large delay interval and wish
to see current status,

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fB?\fR\' | \'\fBh\fR\' :\fIHelp \fR
There are two help levels available.
The first will provide a reminder of all the basic \*(CIs.
If \*(We is\fI secured\fR, that screen will be abbreviated.

Typing 'h' or '?' on that help screen will take you to help for
those \*(CIs applicable to \*(AM.

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fB=\fR\' :\fIExit-Task-Limits \fR
Removes restrictions on which tasks are shown.
This command will reverse any 'i' (idle tasks) and 'n' (max tasks)
commands that might be active.
It also provides for an exit from pid monitoring, 'user' filtering and
'other' filtering.
See the '\-p' \*(CO for a discussion of PID monitoring, the 'U' or 'u'
\*(CIs for user filtering and the 'O' or 'o' \*(CIs for 'other' filtering.

Additionally, any window that has been scrolled will be reset with
this command.
\*(XT 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information regarding
vertical and horizontal scrolling.

When operating in \*(AM this command has a broader meaning.

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fB0\fR\' :\fIZero-Suppress\fR toggle \fR
This command determines whether zeros are shown or suppressed for many
of the fields in a \*(TW.
Fields like UID, GID, NI, PR or P are not affected by this toggle.

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fBA\fR\' :\fIAlternate-Display-Mode\fR toggle \fR
This command will switch between \*(FM and \*(AM.
\*(XT 5. ALTERNATE\-DISPLAY Provisions and the 'g' \*(CI for insight
into \*(CWs and \*(FGs.

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fBB\fR\' :\fIBold-Disable/Enable\fR toggle \fR
This command will influence use of the 'bold' terminfo capability and
alters\fB both\fR the \*(SA and \*(TA for the \*(CW.
While it is intended primarily for use with dumb terminals, it can be
applied anytime.

\*(NT When this toggle is \*O and \*(We is operating in monochrome mode,
the\fB entire display\fR will appear as normal text.
Thus, unless the 'x' and/or 'y' toggles are using reverse for emphasis,
there will be no visual confirmation that they are even on.

.TP 7
*\ \'\fBd\fR\' | \'\fBs\fR\' :\fIChange-Delay-Time-interval \fR
You will be prompted to enter the delay time, in seconds, between
display updates.

Fractional seconds are honored, but a negative number is not allowed.
Entering 0 causes (nearly) continuous updates, with an unsatisfactory
display as the system and tty driver try to keep up with \*(We's demands.
The delay value is inversely proportional to system loading,
so set it with care.

If at any time you wish to know the current delay time, simply ask for
help and view the system summary on the second line.

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fBE\fR\' :\fIExtend-Memory-Scale\fR in Summary Area
With this command you can cycle through the available \*(SA memory scaling
which ranges from KiB (kibibytes or 1,024 bytes) through EiB (exbibytes or
1,152,921,504,606,846,976 bytes).

If you see a '+' between a displayed number and the following label, it
means that \*(We was forced to truncate some portion of that number.
By raising the scaling factor, such truncation can be avoided.

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fBe\fR\' :\fIExtend-Memory-Scale\fR in Task Windows
With this command you can cycle through the available \*(TW memory scaling
which ranges from KiB (kibibytes or 1,024 bytes) through PiB (pebibytes or
1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes).

While \*(We will try to honor the selected target range, additional
scaling might still be necessary in order to accommodate current values.
If you wish to see a more homogeneous result in the memory columns,
raising the scaling range will usually accomplish that goal.
Raising it too high, however, is likely to produce an all zero result
which cannot be suppressed with the '0' \*(CI.

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fBg\fR\' :\fIChoose-Another-Window/Field-Group \fR
You will be prompted to enter a number between 1 and 4 designating the
\*(FG which should be made the \*(CW.
You will soon grow comfortable with these 4 windows, especially after
experimenting with \*(AM.

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fBH\fR\' :\fIThreads-mode\fR toggle \fR
When this toggle is \*O, individual threads will be displayed for all
processes in all visible \*(TWs.
Otherwise, \*(We displays a summation of all threads in each process.

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fBI\fR\' :\fIIrix/Solaris-Mode\fR toggle \fR
When operating in 'Solaris mode' ('I' toggled \*F), a task's \*(Pu usage
will be divided by the total number of \*(PUs.
After issuing this command, you'll be told the new state of this toggle.

.TP 7
*\ \'\fBk\fR\' :\fIKill-a-task \fR
You will be prompted for a PID and then the signal to send.

Entering no PID or a negative number will be interpreted as
the default shown in the prompt (the first task displayed).
A PID value of zero means the \*(We program itself.

The default signal, as reflected in the prompt, is SIGTERM.
However, you can send any signal, via number or name.

If you wish to abort the kill process, do one of the following
depending on your progress:
.Bd -literal
    1) at the pid prompt, type an invalid number
    2) at the signal prompt, type 0 (or any invalid signal)
.Ed

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fBq\fR\' :\fIQuit \fR

.TP 7
*\ \'\fBr\fR\' :\fIRenice-a-Task \fR
You will be prompted for a PID and then the value to nice it to.

Entering no PID or a negative number will be interpreted as
the default shown in the prompt (the first task displayed).
A PID value of zero means the \*(We program itself.

A positive nice value will cause a process to lose priority.
Conversely, a negative nice value will cause a process to be viewed
more favorably by the kernel.
As a general rule, ordinary users can only increase the nice value
and are prevented from lowering it.

If you wish to abort the renice process, do one of the following
depending on your progress:
.Bd -literal
    1) at the pid prompt, type an invalid number
    2) at the nice prompt, type <Enter> with no input
.Ed

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fBW\fR\' :\fIWrite-the-Configuration-File \fR
This will save all of your options and toggles plus the current
display mode and delay time.
By issuing this command just before quitting \*(We, you will be able
restart later in exactly that same state.

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fBX\fR\' :\fIExtra-Fixed-Width \fR
Some fields are fixed width and not scalable.
As such, they are subject to truncation which would be indicated
by a '+' in the last position.

This \*(CI can be used to alter the widths of the following fields:

.Bd -literal
   \fI field  default    field  default    field  default \fR
    GID       5       GROUP     8       WCHAN    10
    RUID      5       RUSER     8
    SUID      5       SUSER     8
    UID       5       USER      8
                      TTY       8
.Ed

You will be prompted for the amount to be added to the default
widths shown above.
Entering zero forces a return to those defaults.

If you enter a negative number, \*(We will automatically increase
the column size as needed until there is no more truncated data.
You can accelerate this process by reducing the delay interval
or holding down the <Space> bar.

\*(NT Whether explicitly or automatically increased, the widths for
these fields are never decreased by \*(We.
To narrow them you must specify a smaller number or restore the defaults.

.TP 7
\ \ \'\fBY\fR\' :\fIInspect-Other-Output \fR
After issuing the 'Y' \*(CI, you will be prompted for a target PID.
Typing a value or accepting the default results in a separate screen.
That screen can be used to view a variety of files or piped command output
while the normal \*(We iterative display is paused.

\*(NT This \*(CI is only fully realized when supporting entries have been
manually added to the end of the \*(We \*(CF.
For details on creating those entries, \*(Xt 6c. ADDING INSPECT Entries.

Most of the keys used to navigate the Inspect feature are reflected in

\ \ \'\fB1\fR\' :\fISingle/Separate-Cpu-States\fR toggle \fR
This command affects how the 't' command's Cpu States portion is shown.
Although this toggle exists primarily to serve massively-parallel SMP

.B Input Requirements
.RS +3

When prompted for selection criteria, the data you provide must take one
of two forms.
There are 3 required pieces of information, with a 4th as optional.
These examples use spaces for clarity but your input generally would not.
.Bd -literal
        #1           \fB#2\fR  #3              ( required )

.Ed

Items #1, #3 and #4 should be self\-explanatory.
Item \fB#2\fR represents both a required \fIdelimiter\fR and the \fIoperator\fR
which must be one of either equality ('=') or relation ('<' or '>').

The '=' equality operator requires only a partial match and that
can reduce your 'if\-value' input requirements.
The '>' or '<' relational operators always employ string comparisons,
even with numeric fields.
They are designed to work with a field's default \fIjustification\fR and
with homogeneous data.
When some field's numeric amounts have been subjected to \fIscaling\fR
while others have not, that data is no longer homogeneous.

If you establish a relational filter and you \fBhave\fR changed the default
'Numeric' or 'Character' \fIjustification\fR, that filter is likely to fail.
When a relational filter is applied to a memory field and you \fBhave not\fR
changed the \fIscaling\fR, it may produce misleading results.
This happens, for example, because '100.0m' (MiB) would appear greater than
'1.000g' (GiB) when compared as strings.

If your filtered results appear suspect, simply altering justification or
scaling may yet achieve the desired objective.

These examples illustrate how 'Other Filtering' can be creatively
applied to achieve almost any desired result.
Single quotes are sometimes shown to delimit the spaces which are part of
a filter or to represent a request for status (^O) accurately.
But if you used them with if-values in real life, no matches would be found.

Assuming field \fBnTH\fR is displayed, the first filter will result in
only multi-threaded processes being shown.
It also reminds us that a trailing space is part of every displayed field.
The second filter achieves the exact same results with less typing.
.Bd -literal
     !nTH=' 1 '                ( ' for clarity only )
     nTH>1                     ( same with less i/p )

With Forest View mode active and the \fBCOMMAND\fR column in view, this

.Bd -literal

The final two filters appear as in response to the status request key (^O).
In reality, each filter would have required separate input.
The \fBPR\fR example shows the two concurrent filters necessary to display
tasks with priorities of 20 or more, since some might be negative.
Then by exploiting trailing spaces, the \fBnMin\fR series of filters could

      "      # discussed below
.Ed

If the $HOME variable is not present, \*(We will try to write the
personal \*(CF to the current directory, subject to permissions.

.\" ......................................................................
.SS 6c. ADDING INSPECT Entries
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
To exploit the 'Y' \*(CI, you must add entries at the\fB end\fR of the
\*(We personal \*(CF.
Such entries simply reflect a file to be read or command/pipeline to be
executed whose results will then be displayed in a separate scrollable,
searchable window.

If you don't know the location or name of your \*(We rcfile, use the 'W'
\*(CI to rewrite it and note those details.

Inspect entries can be added with a redirected echo or by editing the \*(CF.
Redirecting an echo risks overwriting the rcfile should it replace (>)
rather than append (>>) to that file.
Conversely, when using an editor care must be taken not to corrupt existing
lines, some of which will contain unprintable data or unusual characters.

Those Inspect entries beginning with a '#' character are ignored, regardless
of content.
Otherwise they consist of the following 3 elements, each of which\fI must\fR
be separated by a tab character (thus 2 '\\t' total):

.Bd -literal -compact
  .type:  literal 'file' or 'pipe'
  .name:  selection shown on the Inspect screen
  .fmts:  string representing a path or command
.Ed

The two types of Inspect entries are\fI not\fR interchangeable.
Those designated '\fBfile\fR' will be accessed using fopen and
must reference a single file in the '.fmts' element.
Entries specifying '\fBpipe\fR' will employ popen, their '.fmts' element
could contain many pipelined commands and, none can be interactive.

If the file or pipeline represented in your '.fmts' deals with the specific PID
input or accepted when prompted, then the format string must also contain the
'\fB%d\fR' specifier, as these examples illustrate.

.Bd -literal -compact
  .fmts=  /proc/\fI%d\fR/numa_maps
  .fmts=  lsof -P -p\fI %d\fR
.Ed

For '\fBpipe\fR' type entries only, you may also wish to redirect stderr to
stdout for a more comprehensive result.
Thus the format string becomes:

.Bd -literal -compact
  .fmts=  pmap -x %d\fI 2>&1\fR
.Ed

Here are examples of both types of Inspect entries as they might appear
in the rcfile.
The first entry will be ignored due to the initial '#' character.
For clarity, the pseudo tab depictions (^I) are surrounded by an
extra space but the actual tabs would not be.
.Bd -literal -compact

  # pipe ^I Sockets ^I lsof -n -P -i 2>&1
  pipe ^I Open Files ^I lsof -P -p %d 2>&1
  file ^I NUMA Info ^I /proc/%d/numa_maps
  pipe ^I Log ^I tail -n100 /var/log/syslog | sort -Mr
.Ed

Except for the commented entry above, these next examples show what could
be echoed to achieve similar results, assuming the rcfile name was '.toprc'.
However, due to the embedded tab characters, each of these lines should be
preceded by '\fB/bin/echo \-e\fR', not just a simple an 'echo', to
enable backslash interpretation regardless of which shell you use.

.Bd -literal -compact
  "pipe\\tOpen Files\\tlsof -P -p %d 2>&1" >> ~/.toprc
  "file\\tNUMA Info\\t/proc/%d/numa_maps" >> ~/.toprc
  "pipe\\tLog\\ttail -n200 /var/log/syslog | sort -Mr" >> ~/.toprc
.Ed

\fBCaution\fR:
If any inspect entry you create produces output with unprintable characters
they will be displayed in either the ^C notation or hexidecimal <FF> form,
depending on their value.
This applies to tab characters as well, which will show as '^I'.
If you want a truer representation, any embedded tabs should be expanded.

.Bd -literal -compact
  # next would have contained '\\t' ...
  # file ^I <your_name> ^I /proc/%d/status
  # but this will eliminate embedded '\\t' ...
  pipe ^I <your_name> ^I cat /proc/%d/status | expand -
.Ed

The above example takes what could have been a 'file' entry but employs
a 'pipe' instead so as to expand the embedded tabs.

\*(NT While '\fBpipe\fR' type entries have been discussed in terms of pipelines
and commands, there is nothing to prevent you from including \fI shell scripts\fR
as well.
Perhaps even newly created scripts designed specifically for the 'Y' \*(CI.

Lastly, as the number of your Inspect entries grows over time, the 'Options:'
row will be truncated when screen width is exceeded.
That does not affect operation other than to make some selections invisible.

However, if some choices are lost to truncation but you want to see more options,
there is an easy solution hinted at below.

.Bd -literal -compact
  Inspection Pause at pid ...
  Use:  left/right then <Enter> ...
  Options:  help  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 ...
.Ed

The entries in the \*(We rcfile would have a number for the '.name' element and
the 'help' entry would identify a shell script you've written explaining what
those numbered selections actually mean.
In that way, many more choices can be made visible.

.SH 7. STUPID TRICKS Sampler
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Many of these 'tricks' work best when you give \*(We a scheduling boost.
So plan on starting him with a nice value of \-10, assuming you've got
the authority.

.\" ......................................................................
.SS 7a. Kernel Magic
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.\" sorry, just can't help it -- don't ya love the sound of this?
For these stupid tricks, \*(We needs \*(FM.
.\" ( apparently AM static was a potential concern )

.jBu
The user interface, through prompts and help, intentionally implies
that the delay interval is limited to tenths of a second.
However, you're free to set any desired delay.
If you want to see Linux at his scheduling best, try a delay of .09
seconds or less.

For this experiment, under x-windows open an xterm and maximize it.
Then do the following:
.Bd -literal -compact
  . provide a scheduling boost and tiny delay via:
      nice -n -10 \*(We -d.09
  . keep sorted column highlighting \*F so as to
    minimize path length
  . turn \*O reverse row highlighting for emphasis
  . try various sort columns (TIME/MEM work well),
    and normal or reverse sorts to bring the most
    active processes into view
.Ed

What you'll see is a very busy Linux doing what he's always done for you,
but there was no program available to illustrate this.

.jBu
Under an xterm using 'white-on-black' colors, on \*(We's Color Mapping screen
set the task color to black and be sure that task highlighting is set to bold,
not reverse.
Then set the delay interval to around .3 seconds.

After bringing the most active processes into view, what you'll see are
the ghostly images of just the currently running tasks.

.jBu
Delete the existing rcfile, or create a new symlink.
Start this new version then type 'T' (a secret key,
\*(Xt 4c. Task Area Commands, SORTING) followed by 'W' and 'q'.
Finally, restart the program with \-d0 (zero delay).

Your display will be refreshed at three times the rate of the former \*(We,
a 300% speed advantage.
As \*(We climbs the TIME ladder, be as patient as you can while speculating
on whether or not \*(We will ever reach the \*(We.

.\" ......................................................................
.SS 7b. Bouncing Windows
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
For these stupid tricks, \*(We needs \*(AM.

.jBu
With 3 or 4 \*(TDs visible, pick any window other than the last
and turn idle processes \*F using the 'i' \*(CT.
Depending on where you applied 'i', sometimes several \*(TDs are bouncing and
sometimes it's like an accordion, as \*(We tries his best to allocate space.

.jBu
Set each window's summary lines differently: one with no memory ('m'); another
with no states ('t'); maybe one with nothing at all, just the message line.
Then hold down 'a' or 'w' and watch a variation on bouncing windows \*(Em
hopping windows.

.jBu
Display all 4 windows and for each, in turn, set idle processes to \*F using
the 'i' \*(CT.
You've just entered the "extreme bounce" zone.

.\" ......................................................................
.SS 7c. The Big Bird Window
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
This stupid trick also requires \*(AM.

.jBu
Display all 4 windows and make sure that 1:Def is the \*(CW.
Then, keep increasing window size with the 'n' \*(CI until all the other
\*(TDs are "pushed out of the nest".

When they've all been displaced, toggle between all visible/invisible windows
using the '_' \*(CT.
Then ponder this:
.br
   is \*(We fibbing or telling honestly your imposed truth?

.\" ......................................................................
.SS 7d. The Ol' Switcheroo
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
This stupid trick works best without \*(AM, since justification is active
on a per window basis.

.jBu
Start \*(We and make COMMAND the last (rightmost) column displayed.
If necessary, use the 'c' \*(CT to display command lines and ensure
that forest view mode is active with the 'V' \*(CT.

Then use the up/down arrow keys to position the display so that some
truncated command lines are shown ('+' in last position).
You may have to resize your xterm to produce truncation.

Lastly, use the 'j' \*(CT to make the COMMAND column right justified.

Now use the right arrow key to reach the COMMAND column.
Continuing with the right arrow key, watch closely the direction
of travel for the command lines being shown.

.br
   some lines travel left, while others travel right

   eventually all lines will Switcheroo, and move right

Version 1.1, March 2000

Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

.SS 0. PREAMBLE
The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

.SS 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

.SS 2. VERBATIM COPYING
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

.SS 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

.SS 4. MODIFICATIONS
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

.HP 3
.B A\fR.\ Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should,
if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document).
You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
that version gives permission.
.HP 3
.B B\fR.\ List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document
(all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
.HP 3
.B C\fR.\ State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
Version, as the publisher.
.HP 3
.B D\fR.\ Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
.HP 3
.B E\fR.\ Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent
to the other copyright notices.
.HP 3
.B F\fR.\ Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of
this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
.HP 3
.B G\fR.\ Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
.HP 3
.B H\fR.\ Include an unaltered copy of this License.
.HP 3
.B I\fR.\ Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it
an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
If there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating
the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title
Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
previous sentence.
.HP 3
.B J\fR.\ Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
These may be placed in the "History" section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
it refers to gives permission.
.HP 3
.B K\fR.\ In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve
the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
.HP 3
.B L\fR.\ Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their
text and in their titles.
Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
.HP 3
.B M\fR.\ Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".
Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
.HP 3
.B N\fR.\ Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict
in title with any Invariant Section.

.PP
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

.SS 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."

.SS 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

.SS 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

.SS 8. TRANSLATION
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.

.SS 9. TERMINATION
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

.SS 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

.SS ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

.IP "" 3
Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.

Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document under the
terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation;\ \ with the Invariant Sections being
LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the
Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
Free Documentation License".

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
